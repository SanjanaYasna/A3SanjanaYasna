# Reflection
This would be an incredibly fun project if it weren't for the fact that the instructions were vague and misleading. 
A lot of us share the same sentiment. It was only clear when we were given the rankPopulation method that we were expected to hold an arraylist of type Individual, not an arraylist of character arraylists, to contain the individuals for a given generation. Also, edge cases for many methods weren't clear and had to be addressed in slack (like for an odd number of chromosomes, would the middle character immediately map onto itself and gain a point, or no?)
Other than that, this project was a fun way to use arraylists that extend off of another class. It took a bit of thinking for certain parts (like, I had to fituer out a roundabout way of inputing two individual arraylist parents into the breeding constructor of Individual.java, as simply using members.get wouldn't do the trick. For that reason, I think my implementation of the evolve method was a bit messy and I would love to get insight of how you intended for us to do the evolve method) Other than the vauge instructions that had me rewrite big parts of the individual.java file, it was fun to tweak the simulation values and see what would happen. We should do more projects like this sort.
